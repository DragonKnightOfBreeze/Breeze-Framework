# Summary

Provide:

* Some useful text generators.
* Some general dsls.
* Wrapped data loaders and dumpers for multi implementations, such as gson, jackson. 
* Necessary extensions for convenience.

Future plan:

* [ ] Fully adapt to kotlinx-serialization.
* [ ] Provide own-implemented, tiny and flexible implementations.
* [ ] Link each dsl to corresponding loader and dumper.
